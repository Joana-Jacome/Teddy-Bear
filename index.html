        <h1>Vermont Teddy Bear Company</h1>
        <p>The Vermont Teddy Bear Company is one of the largest producers of teddy bears and the largest seller of teddy bears by mail order and Internet. The company handcrafts each of its teddy bears and produces almost 500,000 teddy bears each year.</p>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>In 1981, John Sortino was playing with his son Graham and his collection of teddy bears. Surprised to see that every one of his son's bears wore a tag identifying it as foreign made, Sortino was inspired to bring this American tradition back to its roots by handcrafting bears right here. </p>
